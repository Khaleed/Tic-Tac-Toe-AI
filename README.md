Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
==============

Tictactoe game with a human player against a professional AI player that can place marks on available positions on the game board and also block an opponent's two marks in a row, using pure vanilla JavaScript.  

## Goals

The idea behind this project is to dive deeper into learning native JavaScript (ES5) and think about designing and making a game from scratch without libraries or frameworks. 

Instead of using Min-Max algorithm, the logic behind the game is based on basic logic because it runs faster!
